                <p>This project was for a fine arts class. It was a digital media class that I really enjoyed. This was the mind space project. We were able to make any space that came to mind. I chose to make this futuristic city setting because I really like Sci Fi. </p>

                <p>For one of my graphic design classes, we had to create a color theory diagram that explained the relationships between the different hues on the color wheel as well as explain tint, shade, saturation, temperature, and complementary colors. We also had to incorporate real images that we photographed. I chose to use famous skyscrapers because it made the diagram more interesting and cool to look at.</p>

                <p>In my fine art graphic design class, this assignment had us create two mock up book cover designs for books or movies we've read or watched recently. I chose American Psycho because I had watched it for the first time recently. I used adobe Illustrator for the main illustration, photoshop to make the background and In Design to put everything together.</p>

                <p>I chose Lord of the flies for the second book cover because it was one of my favorite books that we had to read during high school. My first book cover took me the majority of the time I was given for this project. I did this second design in the last few days but I actually ended up liking it more than my first one. I created this one primarily in Illustrator and In Design.</p>
